# Turtle Drawing App
A console-based drawing app powered by the Turtle drawing module. Distance coordinates and custom colors are added on the *main.py* file.

### Features and Skills
- Modules used: Turtle and Random
- Shape dimensions calculated on the *main.py* file
- First app using simple functions, loops, and conditional statements

**See it in action!** [repl](https://repl.it/@adriculous/Drawing-App-with-Turtle).

### Future Plans
One day, I'd like to add a GUI (using Remi Library) for the drawing app to make it a lot more interactive and attractive to the casual users. I'll also try adding all the coordinations of different shapes on a CSV or a JSON file.
